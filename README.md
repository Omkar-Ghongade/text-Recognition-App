<h1>Text Recognition App</h1>


After starting with android development I had attended my first workshop and in the I gained the knowledge about Firebase, ML Kit and many more. During the workshop I was able to make a Fully fleshed App from the scratch.
<br>
The App takes an Image from the Camera or from the Mobile Gallery and reads the text from the Image and shows it on the screen.
